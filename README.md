This game is a University project made for "Introduction to programming" class. For more details, I made a short video wich demonstrates the game functionalities that can be found here: https://youtu.be/yrvomcFm4ag. 
### Running instructions
1. Open a terminal in the location of the folder on your machine
2. Run these 2 commands: <br/>
a) g++ -o main.exe main.cpp includes/*.cpp -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -lwinmm <br/>
b) .\main.exe <br/>
#### P.S: You need to have the C "graphics.h" library installed and also MinGW compiler to avoid any errors. Enjoy!
